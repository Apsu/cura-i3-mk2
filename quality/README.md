QUALITY
===

I attempted to recreate the Slic3r quality profiles for Fast, Normal and Detail -- 0.35mm, 0.2mm and
0.1mm respectively. These files are stored with your Cura application data in the `quality`
directory. On Mac OSX, this is located under `~/Library/Application Support/cura/quality`, and I
suspect on Windows it's under `%AppData%\Local\cura\quality` or similar.

Not all settings translate perfectly but these seem to be just about equivalent. Improvements
welcome!
